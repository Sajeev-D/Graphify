Things to do:
    - Get the LED to display the points of intersection (Done)
        - 4 spaces will show the points of intersection
        - 1 space will show the which function is being shown
    - Create a fucntion to get the min and max of a quadratic curve (Done)
    - input - global array of coefficents of the qudratic curve output (Done)

Things to do:
    - Create an audio for on play on press
    - Create volume control for the audio
    - Change the intersection functions so that:
        - It takes 2 global arrays of size 4 in as arguments.
        - return intersections into up to 3 global variables.
        - Store intersection with axis of each function into 2 global variables.
        - Combine all the find intersection fucntions into 1 function and choose based.
    Note: Coefficients not being used are set to 0
